# Credit Card Fraud Detection with XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It handles extreme class imbalance using **XGBoost** with a weighted loss function (`scale_pos_weight`).

## Key Results
* **Algorithm:** XGBoost
* **Technique:** Class Weighting (`scale_pos_weight`)
* **Business Value:** Optimized **Expected Operational Cost to 26,989 PLN** on the test sample.
* **Performance:** Recall: ~84% | Precision: ~94%
